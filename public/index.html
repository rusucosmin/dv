            This document serves as a brief documentation for catchmentExperiments
          </p>
          <p>
            catchmentExperiments is an SQLite database file created using the program Base for the Mac;
            it should be possible to access the data using any standard SQLite program or interface.
            As an SQLite file it does not require a separate database process to access. This database
            contains information from a number of studies of the effects of different types of land-cover
            change on streamflow. catchmentExperiments is made up of 4 primary tables: catchmentSites,
            experimentalCatchments, controlCatchments, and referencePapers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this particular work, we consider each site to be made up of multiple catchments, each of
            which may serve as a unique study. catchmentSites provides basic information about the sites
            where experiments have taken place, while experimentalCatchment provides detailed information
            about the specific catchment in which a study was done and the results of the study.
          </p>
          <p>
            controlCatchments are the catchments which serve as controls for those in the experimental
            catchments, while referencePapers provide information about the source of the results.
            The results of 4 different hydrologic outcomes of interest are included: annual water
            yield (the total flow out of a watershed in a year), as well as measures of low-flow,
            peak flow, and groundwater recharge that can vary between sites—these should be comparable
            across sites on a relative basis despite the difference in the actual measures.
            Both controlCatchments and experimentalCatchments have foreign keys to catchmentSites to
            link the catchments to the sites. experimentalCatchments also has a foreign key to
            controlCatchments. Finally, both catchmentSites and experimentalCatchments have lists of
            citations that have foreign keys to referencePapers so that each catchment is linked
            with the source of the information for reliability. Further detail on the fields
            in each table will be provided later in the text below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and interactive data visualization tool
            to examine the literature evidence for changes in hydrologic processes from nature-based
            solutions or other land-cover change operations. The primary goal is to summarize the data
            in easy-to-comprehend graphics for the big story, but also to allow users to dig in and
            get more details on what the actual results of the experiments were, as well as where they
            were and the conditions under which they occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            A couple of notes: Feel free to extrapolate the results of catchment experiments to a
            consistent change fraction—while the processes are not linear, they are often close
            enough that this is a reasonable approach, and allows for comparison across sites.
            experimentalCatchments includes a set of flags (1=true, 0=false) for whether the changes
            were found to be statistically significant. Those results with changes that are statistically
            significant are more certain than those which are not—but those which are not can provide
            some supporting evidence for the direction and size of change seen. We are looking to
            summarize the results for each activity (deforestation, afforestation, wetland added,
            wetland removed, etc.) as well as for each hydrologic outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each of these, the strength and certainty of the results, and also the number of
            studies serve as important measures of how well we understand hydrologic behavior under
            these conditions.
