						This database contains information from a number of studies of the effects of different
						types of land-cover change on streamflow. catchmentExperiments is made up of 4 primary
						tables: catchmentSites, experimentalCatchments, controlCatchments, and referencePapers.

					<p>Catchment sites</p>
				</div>
				<div class="message-body">
						Each site is made up of multiple catchments, each of
						which may serve as a unique study. catchmentSites provides basic information about the sites
						where experiments have taken place, while experimentalCatchment provides detailed information
						about the specific catchment in which a study was done and the results of the study.

					<p>Control and experimental catchments</p>
				</div>
				<div class="message-body">
						controlCatchments are the catchments which serve as controls for those in the experimental
						catchments, while referencePapers provide information about the source of the results.
						The results of 4 different hydrologic outcomes of interest are included: annual water
						yield (the total flow out of a watershed in a year), as well as measures of low-flow,
						peak flow, and groundwater recharge that can vary between sites—these should be comparable
						across sites on a relative basis despite the difference in the actual measures.
						Both controlCatchments and experimentalCatchments have foreign keys to catchmentSites to
						link the catchments to the sites. experimentalCatchments also has a foreign key to
						controlCatchments. Finally, both catchmentSites and experimentalCatchments have lists of
						citations that have foreign keys to referencePapers so that each catchment is linked
						with the source of the information for reliability. Further detail on the fields
						in each table will be provided later in the text below.

          <!--   The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and interactive data visualization tool -->
          <!--   to examine the literature evidence for changes in hydrologic processes from nature-based -->
          <!--   solutions or other land-cover change operations. The primary goal is to summarize the data -->
          <!--   in easy-to-comprehend graphics for the big story, but also to allow users to dig in and -->
          <!--   get more details on what the actual results of the experiments were, as well as where they -->
          <!--   were and the conditions under which they occurred. -->
          <!-- </p> -->
          <!-- <p> -->
          <!--   A couple of notes: The results of catchment experiments can be extrapolated. To a -->
          <!--   consistent change fraction—while the processes are not linear, they are often close -->
          <!--   enough that this is a reasonable approach, and allows for comparison across sites. -->
          <!--   experimentalCatchments includes a set of flags (1=true, 0=false) for whether the changes -->
          <!--   were found to be statistically significant. Those results with changes that are statistically -->
          <!--   significant are more certain than those which are not—but those which are not can provide -->
          <!--   some supporting evidence for the direction and size of change seen. We are looking to -->
          <!--   summarize the results for each activity (deforestation, afforestation, wetland added, -->
          <!--   wetland removed, etc.) as well as for each hydrologic outcome. -->
          <!-- </p> -->
          <!-- <p> -->
          <!--   For each of these, the strength and certainty of the results, and also the number of -->
          <!--   studies serve as important measures of how well we understand hydrologic behavior under -->
          <!--   these conditions. -->
